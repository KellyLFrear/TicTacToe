## TicTacToe
A simple but fun Tic-Tac-Toe software.

## Lanuage
Java

## Compiler Initially Used

## Information
Allows the user to play TicTacToe by themselves. They're given a 3x3 2d-array where they can decide where they want to place their "X" or "O" by choosing the row and collumn. The game stops if one person wins, if both players lose or if both draw and the user can decide if they want to play again. No UI, just a software.
